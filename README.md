<h3>High-Performance Native-Driven AI Protocol Adapter Gateway</h3>

**Antigravity-Tools-LS** is a local proxy bridge system designed specifically for the Antigravity IDE. It is not just a simple forwarder; instead, by deeply simulating the IDE plugin protocol, it fully takes over the lifecycle of the native `ls_core` process to provide the ultimate solution for authentication injection, protocol transcoding, and multi-account dispatching.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project Status**: This project is currently in the **Early Experimental Stage (Experimental)**, and many features (such as Thinking extraction) are still under development. **Due to the author's busy work schedule, project updates may not be very frequent.** We strongly welcome developers to submit **Pull Requests (PR)** or Issues to co-maintain and improve this tool.

## 🧠 Core Concept (What is this?)

This project adopts a **Pure Native LS Path** technical architecture:
It exposes standard OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini APIs externally, while internally delegating requests entirely to the native **Antigravity Language Server (`ls_core`)** process.

Unlike Antigravity-Manager, this system will:
1. **Hold Real Credentials**: Simulate the Extension Server behavior to inject OAuth Tokens into `ls_core`.
2. **Establish Native Connections**: The `ls_core` process establishes an HTTPS/gRPC connection directly with Google backend, ensuring the request characteristics are 100% identical to the official plugin.
3. **Protocol-Aware Transcoding**: Parse the streaming output of `ls_core` at the application layer to extract Tool Call tags, image generation results, and Cascade agent states.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🌊 Deep Protocol Bridging
- **Multi-Protocol Adaptation (Multi-Sink)**: Unified conversion from native protocols to OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`), Anthropic (`/v1/messages`), and Gemini Native APIs.
- **Connect+Proto Spoofing**: Fully implements the `SubscribeToUnifiedStateSync` interface, supporting real-time Token updates pushed to memory without restarting the LS process.
- **Cascade Agent Support**: Natively unlocks Cascade Agent mode, supporting stronger context planning and logical reasoning, as well as echoing search citations and sources.

### 🔄 One-Click IDE Account Switching
- **Database-Level Injection**: Automatically identifies macOS/Windows/Linux IDE paths and modifies `state.vscdb` using atomic writes.
- **Seamless Switching**: Automatically force-closes the IDE process, executes Token injection, and automatically restarts (on supported platforms), completely freeing you from manual logins.

### 📦 Industrial-Grade Asset Provisioner
- **Multi-Platform Package Engine**: Supports automatic extraction of `ls_core` and certificates from `.dmg` (macOS), `.deb` (Linux), `.exe` (Windows), and `.tar.gz`.
- **Multi-Level Sync Strategy**: Provides three modes: `Auto` (smart comparison), `LocalOnly` (from local install), and `ForceRemote` (force cloud pull).

### 🛡️ System Governance & Stability
- **LRU Instance Pool Management**: Automatically reclaims expired LS process instances via the LRU strategy to optimize system resource usage.
- **Atomic Configuration Persistence**: All global settings, account ordering, and API Keys are protected by atomic writes to prevent configuration corruption from power loss.
- **Real-Time Event Push**: Frontend echo provided in milliseconds via an SSE-based stream for account changes, task progress, and traffic monitoring.

  lbjlaq/antigravity-tools-ls:latest
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Workspace Visibility Limitations in Remote Docker Deployment**:
> When deploying this project via Docker on a remote server (e.g., VPS or NAS), the LS engine inside the container **cannot directly read** your local workspace code files.
> - **Reason**: Filesystems across different devices are physically isolated. Processes inside the container can only access paths within the container or those mounted via Volumes.
> - **Impact**: While API forwarding will work, advanced features like "Project-wide Code Search" or "Symbol Definitions" (which depend on context) will fail because the LS engine cannot locate the source code.
> - **Recommendation**: For full functionality, ensure the LS service and your code files share the same filesystem view (i.e., run the Docker or binary locally on your development machine).

> [!WARNING]
> **Low Memory OOM Warning**: High concurrency queries may cause `ls_core` to instantly allocate a massive amount of memory (peak >2GB). When deploying on servers with less than 2GB RAM, **you must configure at least 5GB of Swap**. See the [OOM Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/Linux_Deployment_OOM_Guide.md) for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Notice for Windows Users (ASSET SYNC DEPENDENCY)**:
> To enable "Zero-Config Asset Sync" (automatic download and extraction of the core), **7-Zip** must be installed, and the `7z` executable must be in your system `PATH`.
> **Recommended**: Install via `scoop install 7zip` or `choco install 7zip`.
> **Manual Alternative**: If you prefer not to install 7-Zip, manually place the extracted `ls_core` and `cert.pem` from the official installer into the `bin/` directory.

## 🔧 Zero-Config Asset & Version Sync

This project has **bidirectional self-healing capabilities for assets and versions**. The system automatically ensures strict consistency between the runtime `ls_core` binary and the version model signature (`simulated_version`) sent to Google, completely eliminating manual intervention.

### 1. Automatic Alignment Mechanism
- **Local Adaptation**: Automatically scans system paths on startup. If a newer local installation of Antigravity is detected, the system **automatically extracts** core assets and **synchronizes internal simulated version numbers**.
- **Cloud Hot-Update**: If no local installation is found or assets are missing, the system fetches the latest `execution_id` from the official auto-update API and streams down the appropriate asset packages for the platform to perform atomic replacements.
- **Version Persistence**: The aligned version number is recorded in `data/ls_config.json`, ensuring subsequent Request Header signatures perfectly match the physical binary versions and fundamentally preventing `403 Forbidden` errors.

### 2. Asset Provisioning Strategies
Can be dynamically switched via `PUT /v1/settings` or environment variables:
- `Auto` (Default): Local priority. Falls back to Cloud if native App isn't installed locally.
- `LocalOnly`: Strictly extracts only from locally installed Apps. Ideal for offline or restricted environments.
- `ForceRemote`: Ignores local Apps and forcefully pulls the latest assets from cloud repositories.

### 3. Manual Fallback
Although the system supports fully automatic alignment, you can manually override:
- **Manual Drop**: Place `ls_core` and `cert.pem` directly into the `bin/` directory.
- **Config Override**: Modify the `version` field in `data/ls_config.json` to override the simulated version.

## 🤖 Models & Usage

The scope of supported models and usages is highly consistent with the **Antigravity** series.

### 1. Supported Models List
The Model Alias forwarding feature has not yet been achieved. An exact Model ID **must be stringently used** during API requests:

| Provider | Model ID |
|---|---|
| **Gemini** | `gemini-3.1-pro-high`, `gemini-3.1-pro-low`, `gemini-3-flash-agent` |
| **Claude** | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` |
| **Others** | `gpt-oss-120b-medium` |

### 2. Special Limitations
- **Image Generation Models**: Directly calling the image-generation endpoint is not supported yet. Image generation capabilities can only be indirectly triggered via other models calling the support tools.
- **Chain of Thought (Thinking)**: **[Core Notice]** The current version has not yet implemented the streaming extraction and echoing of the `Thinking` process. This feature has been added to the roadmap and is under active development.

## 📝 Narrative Changelog

### v0.0.3 - Protocol Adaptation & Sandbox Bypass (2026-03-26)
- **[Frontend UI] Dashboard Integrity Status Fix**: Introduced a "CHECKING" status to resolve the issue where the Dashboard homepage incorrectly displayed as "DEGRADED" before core asset data finished loading, eliminating initial screen warning flicker.
- **[Core] Sandbox Isolation Bypass**: Removed the virtual workspace restriction (`/tmp/antigravity_workspace`) for the Cascade Agent, fully unlocking the AI agent's ability to read arbitrary local codebase directories on the host machine.
- **[Protocol] Claude CLI Deep Compatibility**: Fixed strict `usage` payloads in Anthropic streaming outputs and added a `/v1/messages/count_tokens` preflight mock endpoint to perfectly support Cherry Studio and the official Claude CLI tool.
- **[Reliability] Fallback Model Injection**: Automatically injects preset/default models (e.g., `gemini-3.1-pro-high`) into memory and the frontend UI when quota detection fails or new accounts haven't synced models, preventing blank UI screens and missing API models.
- **[Provisioner] Strengthened Local-First Validation**: Optimized `AssetProvisioner` logic to immediately skip meaningless cloud downloads once an aligned locally installed Antigravity version is sniffed, speeding up the server startup.
- **[Protocol] Native Gemini Client Integration**: Engineered support for `x-goog-api-key` headers and automatically intercepts/strips operation suffixes (e.g., `:streamGenerateContent`) from model paths at the gateway, unlocking drop-in compatibility for official Gemini ecosystem tools.
- **[Engine] Aligned LS Core Launch Signatures**: Adopted security adaptations targeting recent Antigravity native engines, transitioning to `-https_server_port` and injecting mandatory bidirectional CSRF tokens for Cascade agents to eradicate strict connection-reset issues.
- **[Session] Zero-IO Identity Tracking**: Deprecated high-frequency disk-reads of local `.gemini` authorization files during identity evaluations, swapped to rapid memory-bound MD5 fingerprint checks, mitigating heavy file operations and concurrency contention.
- **[Port Config] Full-Link Custom Backend Port**: Eliminated all hardcoded `5173` port references. Now supports configuring the backend port via CLI, env vars, or directly in the **Dashboard Settings page**, with automatic adaptation for Tauri bridging and OAuth flows.
- **[Accounts] Account Status Misjudgment Fix (Issue #13)**: Optimized the Google subscription tier recognition algorithm, resolving the issue where normal free accounts were incorrectly flagged as "Restricted/Banned," and added support for automatic status recovery.

### v0.0.2 - Containerization & Dependency Optimization (2026-03-25)
- **[Docker] Runtime Self-Healing**: Resolved startup crashes in `debian:bookworm-slim` by adding minimal required libraries for `ls_core` (`libnss3`, `libgbm1`, etc.).
- **[Core] Decoupled GUI Dependencies**: Refactored `rfd` (file dialog) as an optional feature. Docker builds now automatically exclude GTK/Wayland links, maintaining a minimal image size.
- **[API] Environment-Aware Fallback**: Optimized path selection APIs to return user-friendly errors in headless environments instead of crashing.

### v0.0.1 (Experimental) - Initial Core Features Release
This version finalizes project initiation and infrastructure. Major functionalities include:
- **[Core Engine] Pure Native LS Bridging**: Transparent full-stack gateway seamlessly connecting to Google via the IDE's native protocol by fully managing the `ls_core` lifecycle.
- **[Cross-Platform] Atomic Account Switching**: Breakthrough parsing of the `state.vscdb` Protobuf schema, enabling macOS/Windows/Linux automated credential extraction and isolated injection.
- **[Transcoder] Multi-Sink Streaming Adapters**: First-to-market support for real-time transcoding of native raw texts / structured responses into Standard OpenAI Chat, Anthropic Messages, and Native Gemini APIs.
- **[Governance] Fully Auto Asset Sync**: Built-in intelligent sync system decides self-governed sourcing (extract local App or Cloud downloading) based on host environments, maintaining flawless version alignments to prevent bans.
- **[System Resources] LRU Reclaim Defense**: Realized timeout detection for persistent processes, forcing the cleanup of zombie `ls_core` processes to avoid OOM in lightweight containers.
